# The downstream version of WPE is forked from the official one.
# This version includes some features that have not yet been considered
# (or accepted) for merging upstream, and also includes some extra quirks
# for specific embedded hardware.
#
# This version of WPE is not selected by default on this layer, as the
# upstream versions are preferred. To select it, add on your local.conf
# conf file the line below:
#
# PREFERRED_VERSION_wpewebkit = "1.downstream%"
#

# NOTE: The build of this recipe is currently broken after the versioning
#        changes done on wpebackend recipes. Remove this note and update
#        the commit below once that is fixed on the downstream repository.
